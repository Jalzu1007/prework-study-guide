        <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, is the most basic building block of websites. It handles the content of a website, as well as its structure and the meaning of each element on the page. Along with CSS and JavaScript, HTML is one of the three core languages of the web.
        </li>
        <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.
        </li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The head element is a container for metadata. Meta elements contain information about the page that is used by the browser. The user won't see the information in the head or meta elements.
        </li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     </ul>
      </section>
   
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
          <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is the language used to describe the presentation of a website that’s created with HTML and how each element on a webpage is rendered.
          </li>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users. Whereas HTML strictly handles the content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.
          </li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.
          </li>
          <li></li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

          <li>Phrase: "in the cloud" a series of software and servers that run on the internet and store your data remotely.</li>
          <li>Version Control Systems: Allow us to track and manage changes to our code base.</li>
          <li>Git is a free, open source version control system that allows web developers to collaborate on projects without overwriting each other's work. It also allows developers to revert to previous versions of the code if a problem is discovered.
          </li>
          <li>GitHub is the largest provider of internet hosting for software and web development code, and provides the version control functionality of Git in a central repository.
          </li>
          <li>Repository: Every project on GitHub is called a repository. Folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history.
          </li>
          <li>Markdown (.md): the way that the content files are formatted in GH. A way to write for the web using plain text; easily converts to HTML.
          </li>
          <li>Branch: Workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site. Create a new branch for your work and name it to best describe the work.
          </li>
          <li>Commit Changes: Saving a new version of the file you’re working on. Adds changes to your branch.</li>
          <li>Pull Request (PR): Asking for changes on a branch to merge to another branch.Way to discuss and review your work with others.
          </li>
          <li>Merge: When a PR is approved, changes are “pulled in” or merged into main branch.
          </li>
          <li>Issue: Way to report new tasks or content fixes. Track progress on project board. Open an issue for a new task and close once done.
          </li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
         <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites. Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.
          </li>
          <li>In web development, JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive. Every time you do something with a webpage, such as click a button, retrieve data, or fill out a form, JavaScript is at work!
